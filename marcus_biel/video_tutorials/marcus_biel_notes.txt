Class Object
    Is the super class of all objects in the java universe
What is the java Collections framework
    It is a library , a toolbox , of generic interfaces and classes.
    List<String> myList = new ArrayList<String>(100);
    Here we tell the compiler that myList variable will never have
    any values other than a list of String objects..
    Also note the use of the List type instead of ArrayList.This makes the 
    code more flexible.You will only create the object once 
    and end up using it in many places
When you declare an ArrayList as List you can later on change
the ArrayList to a LinkedList by simply 

Collection<String> myList = new ArrayList<String>(100);
ArrayList is the default value for List
When declaring List it is always a good idea to use ArrayList because it makes it more flexible
